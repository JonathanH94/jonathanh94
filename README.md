### Hi I'm Jonathan Hateley,

I'm a Data Engineer working in the Healthcare industry, building scalable systems to support business intelligence, reporting, and operational workflows.


I mainly work with SQL, Python, and PowerShell to create ETL pipelines, automate tasks, and develop backend services. 

I'm passionate about expanding my skills beyond traditional Data Engineering, so you'll find a variety of projects here where I experiment with programming languages and technologies outside my usual scope.

Feel free to explore my repositories and connect!
